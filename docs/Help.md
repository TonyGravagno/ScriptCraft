# Getting Help for ScriptCraftJS

As of September 2017, here is where you can get help for ScriptCraftJS:

* The [Google Group][scforum] has many users and developers who are anxious to help.
* The [Issues][repo] section at GitHub. Check to see if someone else has reported a problem before reporting it again. This is more for reporting problems with the software than for asking HowTo questions, but all questions are welcome. You are encouraged to look at the source code, to see what the code is doing, and to read the comments in the code.
* Visit the [Gitter Chatroom][gitchat] where you may get a live response to a question.
* To keep up with changes, see [Tony's blog][blogt].
